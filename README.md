# Transfer Learning

This project aims to develop an image classifier to label images of 20 bird species using limited data of 820 training samples. Empirical regularization has been performed. by randomly cropping, rotating, flipping, contrasting, and translating images for data augmentation. VGG16 and EfficientNetB0 are used for classification, trained on ImageNet, using ReLU activation function along with a softmax layer and ADAM optimizer.
